    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hi, I’m Joshua Aromin from La Union. I’m a freshman Computer Science student at Saint Louis University in Baguio. <p>
    I love playing badminton, chess, volleyball, and online games. These are some of the things that help me relax and enjoy my free time.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also like organizing things and keeping everything neat and in order. I’ve always been curious about technology <p>and how things work, 
    which is why I chose to study Computer Science.<p> I’m just starting to learn programming, but I’m excited to develop my skills 
    and improve step by step.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to find a stable job in the future, build a good career, and make my parents proud through the things I achieve. <p>
    I believe that with patience and effort, I’ll be able to reach my dreams someday.
  </p>
